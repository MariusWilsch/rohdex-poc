# System Overview Analysis - Rohdex POC

## Business Context

Q: "Describe the current situation, desired outcome, and what would make this project a complete success or failure from a business perspective."

A: The current situation involves a manual process of creating Packing List documents by transferring data from multiple input sources: Partie Excel files (containing weight and quantity data from digital scales) and a Wahrheitsdatei (containing reference information). The desired outcome is to automate this process, eliminating manual data transfer and reducing errors. Success would be measured by:

1. Accurate automated generation of Packing Lists
2. Handling variable numbers of input files (1-4 Partie files)
3. Correct integration of reference data
4. Reliable email-based document exchange

Failure would be:

1. Inaccurate data transfer or calculations
2. Inability to handle variable input configurations
3. Unreliable document delivery

| Answered | Source | New Questions Generated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YES | DesignDocRohdex-21.01.25.txt | - What is the expected volume of documents to be processed? |
|  |  | - Are there specific timing requirements for document generation? |
|  |  | - What validation steps are required in the current manual process? |

## Technical Boundaries

Q: "Walk me through how this solution will fit into your current technical landscape and what would prevent it from working effectively."

A: The solution needs to integrate with:

1. Email-based file exchange system for receiving Partie files (output from digital scales) and delivering results
2. Excel-based templates for Packing List generation
3. File processing system for data extraction and transformation

Technical constraints include:

1. Fixed format of Partie files (CSV format with specific column structure)
2. Need for accurate weight calculations and conversions (kg to lbs using 2.2046 factor)
3. Variable number of input files (1-4 Partie files per container)
4. Requirement to maintain data integrity across document transformations

> 
> A:”””
> 
> Judgment: Yes
> 
> Rationale: The unchecked boxes in our Success Criteria directly correspond to the technical details we're missing. We cannot meaningfully check off items like "Access methods documented", "Authentication requirements specified", or "Technical constraints documented" without first knowing the specific Gmail API implementation details I asked about.
> 
> Additional Context Needed: While we have the high-level decision to use Gmail for the POC, we cannot fully validate the success criteria until we have the technical implementation details. This is evidenced by how our current success criteria items map to our unanswered questions:
> 
> - Access methods documented ➔ Needs OAuth2/API scope details
> - Authentication requirements ➔ Needs account type/2FA decisions
> - Technical constraints ➔ Needs API limits/attachment handling details
> - File handling capabilities ➔ Needs MIME types/email format decisions
> 
> Therefore, we should keep these items unchecked until we have the technical implementation details, as they are direct dependencies for validating success.
